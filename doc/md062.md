# `MD062` - Image links should reference existing files

Tags: `images`, `links`

Aliases: `md-image-links-exist`

This rule is triggered when an image link references a file that does not exist.

```markdown
![Alt text](./missing-image.png)
```

To fix this issue, ensure the image file exists at the specified path, or update
the link to point to a valid image file.

```markdown
![Alt text](./existing-image.png)
```

## Notes

This rule only checks relative image links (paths that don't start with `http://`,
`https://`, or other URL schemes). External URLs are not validated.

For root-relative links (paths starting with `/`), the `md_root_path` setting can
be used to specify the base directory for resolution.

## Rationale

Missing images result in broken content and a degraded user experience. Validating
image links helps ensure documentation displays correctly.
