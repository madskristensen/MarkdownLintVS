# `MD061` - File links should reference existing files

Tags: `links`

Aliases: `md-file-links-exist`

This rule is triggered when a file link references a file that does not exist.

```markdown
[Link to file](./missing-file.md)
```

To fix this issue, ensure the linked file exists at the specified path, or update
the link to point to a valid file.

```markdown
[Link to file](./existing-file.md)
```

## Notes

This rule only checks relative file links (paths that don't start with `http://`,
`https://`, or other URL schemes). External URLs are not validated.

For root-relative links (paths starting with `/`), the `md_root_path` setting can
be used to specify the base directory for resolution.

## Rationale

Broken links create a poor user experience and indicate documentation that may be
out of date. Validating file links helps maintain documentation quality.
